# AHK-EDE - Enhanced Desktop Experience

Tool to handle different actions on Windows and Mouse within a Multi-Desktop-Environment

The idea is based on [WindowPad](http://http://www.autohotkey.com/board/topic/19990-windowpad-window-moving-tool)/[WindowPadX](https://github.com/hoppfrosch/WindowPadX), which basically lacks the ability to provide some windows history. Most of the functionality of [WindowPadX](https://github.com/hoppfrosch/WindowPadX) should be available at the end ...
